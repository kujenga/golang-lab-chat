# Populate `ChatRoom` and `ChatUser` (5-10 minutes)

## Goals

In this lesson, we'll setup the ChatRoom and ChatUser structs. 

Let's review the design of the data structures and some of the requirements:

  1. There is one `ChatRoom` in the app.
  1. The `ChatRoom` must know about all of the active connections.
  1. Each connection is tracked in a `ChatUser` object.
  1. The `ChatRoom` must be able to receive messages from a single connection,
  and replay it back to the other connections.  Otherwise, it will not be a very good chatroom!
  1. When a new connection is established, the `ChatRoom` must be notified
  of these new connections.

## Steps

1. Find the `ChatRoom` struct in `chat.go`.

  ```go
  type ChatRoom struct {
    // TODO: populate this   
  }
  ```
  
  1. :star2: Add to the `ChatRoom` struct:
    * a private member `users` of type `map[string]*ChatUser`
    * a private member channel `incoming` of type `chan string`
    * a private member channel `joins` of type `chan *ChatUser`
    * a private member channel `disconnects` of type `chan string`
  1. :star2: Initialize all of these data structures in the `NewChatRoom()` constructor.

1. Find the `ChatUser` struct in `chat.go`.

  ```go
  type ChatUser struct {
    // TODO: populate this   
  }
  ```
  
  1. :star2: Add to the `ChatUser` struct
    * a private member `conn` of type `net.Conn` 
    * a private member `disconnect` of type `bool` 
    * a private member `username` of type `string` 
    * a private member channel `outgoing` of type `chan string` 
    * a private member `reader` of type `*bufio.Reader` 
    * a private member `writer` of type `*bufio.Writer` 
  1. :star2: Initialize all of these data structures in the `NewChatRoom()` constructor.
    * `bufio.NewReader/bufio.NewWriter` should accept the `conn` to create the `reader`
    and `writer` variables.
    * `disconnect` should be initially set to false

1. Don't worry too much about what all of these variables are for right now.
As we fill out the rest of the code, you will gain a better understanding of what they will be used for, or you can ask your TA for more information.

  [You can also view the comments on the structs here](code/03-data-structures/chat.go).

1. Verify the code still runs when you type `go run chat.go`.
