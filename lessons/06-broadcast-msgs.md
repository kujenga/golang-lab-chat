# Lesson 6 - Broadcasting Messages (15-20 minutes)

## Goals

Finally, to the heart of the matter! Chatting!

To chat with each other, we need to be able to read messages from each 
individual `ChatUser`'s socket, then broadcast them back to all of the other user
sockets.  

Here's how it will work:

  * We have a channel `ChatRoom.incoming` where we will put all of the messages
  that come in from all of the user sockets.
  * Each `ChatUser` object will be modified to have a loop that looks for any new lines
  read in from the client, and sends it to `ChatRoom.incoming` channel.
  * In our `ChatRoom.ListenForMessages`, we will look for any new messages
  on `ChatRoom.incoming` and call `Broadcast` to broadcast it out to all of
  the other connected sockets.

Got it?? Not sure? No worries, Let's go through the steps.

## Steps


1. Look for the empty `ChatUser.ReadIncomingMessages` function. Let's implement it so it constantly reads incoming messages from the socket buffer.

  ```go
    func (cu *ChatUser) ReadIncomingMessages(chatroom *ChatRoom) {
    	// TODO: read incoming messages in a loop
    }
  ```
  1. In `ChatUser.ReadIncomingMessages`, implement the following:

    1. :star2: Create a `for/select` loop, and ensure this loop runs in a goroutine.
    1. :star2: In the loop, call `cu.ReadLine` to read an incoming msg.
    1. :star2: Prepend the incoming msg with the username surrounded by brackets, e.g.: `msg = "[" + cu.username "]" + msg`
    1. :star2: Place this modified message on the `chatroom.incoming` queue.

  1. Now, you need to make sure that the `ReadIncomingMessages` goroutine is started
  in `ChatUser.Login`.  
    
    1. :star2: Modify the `Login` function to start the goroutine for `ReadIncomingMessages` after `WriteOutgoingMessages`.

1. Cool. Remember `ChatRoom.ListenForMessages()`?  Let's modify it so it sees
  the new messages on the `chatroom.incoming` channel.

  1. :star2: Add a 'case' within the `for/select` loop that reads a msg string from the `incoming` channel.
  1. :star2: Call `ChatRoom.Broadcast` on the read msg.

  At the end it will look like:

  ```go
  func (cr *ChatRoom) ListenForMessages() {
	  go func() {
	  	for {
	  		select {
	  		case msg := <-cr.incoming:
	  			cr.Broadcast(msg)
	  		case user := <-cr.joins:
	  			cr.users[user.username] = user
	  			cr.Broadcast("*** " + user.username + " just joined the chatroom")
	  		}
	  	}
	  }()
  }
  ```
  
1. Verify everything works as designed.  Connect to port 6677, then type a message and
hit enter to send a chat msg to everyone. You can try connecting with 
multiple simultaneous clients to test how messages look to other users.

  ```bash
   $ nc localhost 6677
   Welcome to my chat server!
   Please enter your username: funcuddles
   Welcome, funcuddles
   *** funcuddles just joined the chatroom
   hello this is dog
   [funcuddles] hello this is dog
   ```
